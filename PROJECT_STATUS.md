# PROJECT_STATUS.md

Last updated: 2026-07-13

This file records approved decisions and the verified implementation state. Always inspect the current repository before acting.

## Website

- Repository: `martynazwoinska/martynazwoinska.github.io`
- Hosting: GitHub Pages from `main` and the repository root
- Stack: plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Main visual direction: restrained Art Nouveau / Pre-Raphaelite
- Primary colours: emerald, antique gold, muted violet or berry
- Display font: Cormorant Garamond
- Light and dark themes must remain functional
- Homepage language options: English, Swedish, and Polish

## Parallel ownership

- `agent/site-architecture`: homepage, shared files, documentation and integration
- `agent/cabinet`: `cabinet-of-curiosities/**` only
- `agent/game-worms`: `game-of-worms/**` only
- independent QA: read-only review with no file edits

The durable workflow is documented in `docs/agent-workflow.md`. The shared layer uses prefixed `--site-*` tokens and preserves the existing `language` and `theme` storage keys. Translation dictionaries remain page-local.

## Beyond Research

Approved information architecture:

```text
Beyond Research
├── The Game of Worms
└── The Cabinet of Curiosities
```

### The Game of Worms card

- Description: `A browser game inspired by nematode biology, with creative input from my children.`
- Action: `Play →`
- Destination: `game-of-worms/index.html`
- The card includes a restrained interactive nematode preview.

### The Cabinet of Curiosities card

- Description: `Craft chocolate became another subject I got really into!`
- Action: `Explore →`
- Destination: `cabinet-of-curiosities/index.html`
- The official Cocoa of Excellence Flavour Wheel is the only approved preview graphic.
- The Cabinet link and flavour-wheel button remain separate semantic controls.

The two cards have equal visual weight, stack on mobile, retain emerald and antique-gold borders, preserve visible focus, and respect reduced motion.

## Verified implementation on `main`

- The homepage, Game of Worms, and Cabinet of Curiosities are deployed through GitHub Pages.
- Shared theme and language-preference handling is present under `shared/`.
- Homepage behaviour and translations are separated into `home.js` and `home-i18n.js`.
- The Cabinet uses separate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, translation, and data files.
- The Cabinet presents the authentic photographed object board inside an extended fantasy surround.
- The board has percentage-based responsive hotspots for 35 chocolate packages, two crocheted eyes, and the S-Foodies sticker.
- A browseable collection index and reusable accessible object-detail dialog are implemented.
- The Cocoa of Excellence Flavour Wheel opens in a separate accessible dialog with source and licence attribution.
- The long crocheted worm, blue crocheted octopus, and surrounding decoration remain non-interactive.
- No temporary deployment workflow remains under `.github/workflows/`.

## Cabinet source images

Approved stylised source image:

```text
cabinet-of-curiosities/assets/cabinet-of-curiosities.png
```

Untouched original photograph:

```text
cabinet-of-curiosities/assets/cabinet-original-photo.jpg
```

Do not overwrite or confuse these files. The original photograph is the source of truth for wrapper identities, wrapper text, and object placement. Live composite derivatives must preserve the authentic photographed board and extend only the surrounding fantasy setting.

## Confirmed chocolate information

- Storm & Bille: Uganda chilli bar, 70%.
- Raaka: Tanzania, 100%.
- Vigdis Rosenkilde: Echarete, 80%.
- Kamm: Ecuador, 85%.
- Luisa Abram: Rio Juruá, 70%.
- Paradai: Nakhon Si Thammarat Red Pod, 70%; EU distributor:
  `https://premifair.com/products/paradai-schokolade-nakhon-si-thammarat-red-pod-70-thailand`
- Paradai: Chanthaburi, 70%; EU distributor:
  `https://premifair.com/products/paradai-chanthaburi-70`
- Malmö Chokladfabrik: Craft Madagascar; the central rectangular wrapper showing the chocolate-making process.
- Friis-Holm mini bars share:
  `https://friisholmchokolade.dk/products/bag-mix-12-x-5-g`
- Taza: the circular package, not the Malmö Chokladfabrik wrapper.
- Zotter Labooko White: the small pale wrapper on the right, not Omnom.
- Chocolate Naive: Xocoatl.

Other labels marked `visible` in `cabinet-data.js` were read from the original photograph and linked where a suitable page was found, but they are not equivalent to explicit user confirmation. Do not silently promote them to `confirmed`.

## Crochet eyes

Both crocheted eyes use the confirmed Blooming Eye Crochet Pattern:

```

The Etsy pattern is the only external link planned for these objects.

## Current follow-up work

1. Run a focused cross-site QA pass at the widths defined in `docs/agent-workflow.md`.
2. Verify keyboard navigation, dialog focus restoration, reduced motion, language and theme persistence, console errors, and horizontal overflow.
3. Review entries marked `visible` against the original photograph before treating them as confirmed.
4. Review unreferenced intermediate Cabinet composites before deciding whether they should remain as source history or be removed.
5. Keep `game-of-worms/` unchanged during Cabinet-only work.
